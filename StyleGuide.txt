Preprocessor Directives:
	- Preprocessor directives (e.g. #define, #include) should be at the top, with the exception of #endif.
	- The # symbol should be pronounced "hashtag".
	- There should be a line between the #ifndef/#define and #include directives.
	- The #define should be after the #include directives, with a line in between.
	- There should be a line between the preprocessor directives and the rest of the code.
	- There should be a line between the end of an if block and the "#endif."
	- Constants defined using #define should be in ALL_CAPITAL_LETTERS with underscores between words, e.g. #define SUM_OF_ALL_NATURAL_NUMBERS -1/12.
	- Note: the default constants are in CamelCase. Change them.
	e.g.:
	#ifndef BRUH_H
	#define BRUH_H
	
	#include "Bro.h"
	#swag
	
	#endif

Indentation:
	- 4 Spaces = 1 Tab
	- Indent one tab for each level of brackets surround the code.
	- Indent one tab for access specifiers (private, protected, public).
	e.g.:
	Class Robot
	{
		private:	
			void SomeFunction(void)
			{
				printf("hi");
			}
	}
	
Comments:
	- Comments that are more than one line should have their own line and come before the lines of code they are commenting on.
	- Comments that are only one line share a line with the first line of the code they comment on.
	- The line after the /* of a block comment should be blank.
	- Each subsequent line should be preceded by a space, an asterisk, and two more spaces.
	- The */ should be indented by one space. The rest of the line should be blank.
	
Classes:
	- The opening brace ({) goes on the line following the class declaration, the closing brace (}) goes on the line following the last line of code.
	- Class names should be in CamelCase (first letter of each word capitalized) with the first letter capitalized, except for acronyms and initialisms,
	  which should be in all capitals.
	- There should be one line between the closing brace of the old class and the function declaration of the next function.
	e.g.:
	Class Bruh
	{
		private:
			Bruh();
			void Bro();
		public:
			void Brah();
			void Bru();
	}
	
Objects:
	- When a class represents a singular physical object, give it the same name as the original class in camelCase with the first letter lowercase,
	  e.g. DriveTrain* drivetrain.
	- Use pointers!
	- When there will be multiple instances of the same class (e.g. joysticks and motors) name them clearly, in camelCase with the first letter lowercase,
	  e.g. frontRightMotor, joystick1.
	  
Functions:
	- Functions should be declared in the header file and initialized in the main file.
	- Functions that are supposed to be empty should say, "return;" so it is clear that no code is missing.
	- The opening brace goes on the line following the function declaration, the closing brace goes on the line following the last line of code.
	- Function names should be in CamelCase with the first letter capitalized.
	- There should be one line between the closing brace of the old function and the function declaration of the next function.
	e.g.:
	void UselessFunction(void) 
	{
		return;
	}
	
Variables:
	- Variables should be declared in the header file and initialized in the main file.
	- Variable names should be in camelCase with the first letter lowercase. Member variables should be prefixed with m_.
	- Constants should not be declared using "const": they should be declared using preprocessor directives.

Operators:
	- The pointer operators (* and ->) and the scope operator (::) should be used without a space.
	- All other operators should be used with spaces between them and the things they operate on.

Motors:
	- Whenever motors are declared, initialized, or called, they should be in the following order: front left, front right, rear left, rear right.
